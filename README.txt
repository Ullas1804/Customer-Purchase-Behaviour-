Project Description:

This project involves analyzing customer purchase behavior based on their age segments. The goal is to identify the top-selling products for each age group, including young, middle-aged, and old customers.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to:

Identify the top 5 products purchased by each age segment (young, middle-aged, and old customers).

Methodology:

The project involves the following steps:

Data preparation: The customer purchase data is divided into three age segments: young, middle-aged, and old customers.
Data analysis: The top 5 products for each age segment are identified using the value_counts() function.
Data visualization: The top-selling products for each age segment are visualized using bar plots, with separate plots for each age group.
Key Insights:

The project provides insights into the purchasing behavior of customers based on their age segments. By identifying the top-selling products for each age group, businesses can:

Tailor their marketing strategies to target specific age segments.
Optimize their product offerings to meet the demands of each age group.
Improve customer satisfaction by providing products that cater to their needs.
Output:

The project outputs three separate bar plots, each displaying the top 5 products for young, middle-aged, and old customers. The plots provide a visual representation of the top-selling products for each age segment, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about their product offerings and marketing strategies.
